# FinanceHub – AI Onboarding Concept (Creativity Test)

## Idea
WalletHub already has strong data and tools. The main challenge for new users is **knowing where to start and understanding what they see**.

This concept adds a **public AI onboarding assistant** that explains the site in plain language before login or personalization.

## What the AI Does
- Explains key sections (Credit, Budgeting, Offers, Investments, Identity)
- Answers simple questions like “Where should I start?” or “Why do credit scores change?”
- Suggests next steps instead of showing everything at once
- Uses examples only — **no private data access**

## Why It’s an Improvement
- Reduces confusion for first-time users  
- Shortens time-to-value  
- Improves feature discovery  
- Reinforces WalletHub’s strengths without redesigning the site  

## Why It’s Innovative
The innovation is not adding more features, but **using AI as a guide** at the moment users feel lost — before login and before commitment.

This is an independent prototype for a creativity exercise. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by WalletHub.
